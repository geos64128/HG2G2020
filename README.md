Hitchhikers Guide to GEOS v2020


The Goal of this Document is
1. combine the collective works from:
The Hitchhikers to GEOS
by Berkely Softworks 1988
Geos Programmerâ€™s Reference Guide by
by Alexander Donald Boyce 1986
Revised by Bo Zimmerman 1997
The Official GEOS Programmers Reference Guide
by Berkeley Softworks 1987
Information now available from the Dissembled GEOS Kernal
Information Obtained from my Disassembly of GEOS Applications.
If possible. All new KERNAL additions from Wheels 4.4 and from MP3+
MP3 is still being actively developed and it is open source so this should
not be a problem. Wheels 4.4 internals has been dissembled so this should be
manageable as well but I have not yet started on either of these additions.
Any and all other relevant information from others sources including from my
own experience developing for GEOS. With appropriate credits given for all
source Document s.
2. Make all information in the document Hyperlinked.
3. Remove all Apple Information from this collection. When I get geoAssembler
ported into the Apple GEOS world There will be another document made from
this one with all the apple information in it.
This will provide a one stop resource for programming information.
The slowest part of the process is converting the OCR Scanned originals back into
editable document form that can be easily edited.
Volunteers are welcome to assist...
My goal is too add 1 page a day to this document until it is completed.
